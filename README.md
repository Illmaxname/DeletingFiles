# Info
A **main.cpp**(virus) is a program that deletes all files (not directories) in a specified non-system folder every 10 seconds. The software does not have a graphical interface and closes the console immediately upon startup, so it will not be possible to complete the execution process in an obvious way.<br/>
The main.exe program, when launched, creates an entry in the autorun menu of the Windows 10 operating system, and at each system startup, the virus starts execution and does not stop it until forced termination in the task manager, system shutdown, or termination by the antivirus program.<br/>
The virus program can be disguised as any executable file and set to delete files in any non-system directory.
